# Pizzazz Time

Configuration for ordering Dominos leveraging the [Terraform Provider for Dominos Pizza](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/MNThomson/dominos/latest/docs).

Picture this:

It's Wednesday night.  Your sitting there at your computer idly browsing the web, and then all the sudden you see a notification informing you your housemate submitted a pull request to kick off an order for pizza.  

You look over the changes and see if everything's to your liking.  Don't want bell peppers?  Submit a 'Request changes' to have them removed from the config.  Maybe add a 2 liter soda, because why not?  Meanwhile your other housemate just straight up give a "LGTM".  Probably didn't even look over the thing.  But you are a discerning PR reviewer, and you're going to give it your all.  

After some offline discussion, suggesting other improvements, and getting the requested changes applied, you finally give approval with full confidence.  The code is promptly merged into the main branch, and with the magic of automation your order is already being kicked off.  

After 20 minutes, the pizza arrives and is then promptly consumed.

End scene.
